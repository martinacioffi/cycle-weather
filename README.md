See weather forecast along a cycling route (.gpx file)

## Description
Cycle Weather is a simple HTML page that allows you to visualize the weather forecast along a cycling route defined in a GPX file. It uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather data and displays it on a map.

You can choose between two maps:
* OpenCycleMap
* OpenTopoMap

The app also allows you to insert breaks along the route, which will be displayed on the map. To insert a new break, you can either insert the km at which the break will start; or click on the map to select the position of the break. Then, insert the break's length in number of minutes.
